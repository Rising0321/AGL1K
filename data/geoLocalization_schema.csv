It was a very windy day but I managed to get into a corner against the thick church walls to shield my recorder from the worst of the blasts. This gives the recording a bit of a claustrophobic feeling I think, as you can hear sounds reflecting back from a thick stone wall in a confined area. Alas with EDIROL R-09 and its little fluffy wind cover there is not much more to be done other than trying to find a non-windy spot! A pigeon started cooing, some people passed by, chatting, and our paper bag from Simon's pie shop rustled in the wind.
