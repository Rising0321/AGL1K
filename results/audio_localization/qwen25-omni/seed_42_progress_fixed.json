Chris Webber was telling me he'd been up at 5am on the morning of the open day to deliver several sets of twins and triplets. The ewes are all sitting on lovely clean straw, patiently waiting, with huge sides. The recently lambed ewes are there with their babies, licking and cleaning them, and getting them to suckle. It's an amazing place to witness new life, but it's also very real and unromantic and I really enjoyed hearing the many conversations around me with parents explaining where babies come from. The ewes have a much deeper sound than the lambs, but you can occasionally hear the tiny bleatings of a just-born sheep in this recording.",

We wandered up there and noticed the sound of some wind chimes hanging outside a shop marked \"\"tiny book store\"\". It was a very windy day but I managed to get into a corner against the thick church walls to shield my recorder from the worst of the blasts. This gives the recording a bit of a claustrophobic feeling I think, as you can hear sounds reflecting back from a thick stone wall in a confined area. Alas with EDIROL R-09 and its little fluffy wind cover there is not much more to be done other than trying to find a non-windy spot! A pigeon started cooing, some people passed by, chatting, and our paper bag from Simon's pie shop rustled in the wind. The clock struck the hour about three minutes past the hour.",

        "description": "While hiking at Dankeng Mountain, Taichung I heard an Erhu sound from one of the pavillions. Three friends were talking in native Taiwanese language. One of them was practicing erhu. I sat down for ten minutes to rest during this difficult hike and I recorded his play and their chat. I found out they were talking about a friend who used to hike together with the erhu player.<br /><br />The player immediately quit playing when I took a picture. He must have been too shy as he is still learning to master the instrument.<br /><br />Recorded at Touke Mountain, Dakeng, Taichung, Taiwan with my Tascam DR-40<br /><br />Feel free to download this upload for any purpose.
